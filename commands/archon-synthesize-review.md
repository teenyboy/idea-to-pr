# Synthesize Review

---

## Your Mission

Read all parallel review agent artifacts, synthesize findings into a consolidated report, and write the final artifact.

**Output artifact**: `.claude/skills/idea-to-pr/artifacts/review/consolidated-review.md`

---

## Phase 1: LOAD - Gather All Findings

### 1.1 Read Scope

```bash
cat .claude/skills/idea-to-pr/artifacts/review/scope.md
```

### 1.3 Read All Agent Artifacts

```bash
# Read each agent's findings
cat .claude/skills/idea-to-pr/artifacts/review/code-review-findings.md
cat .claude/skills/idea-to-pr/artifacts/review/error-handling-findings.md
cat .claude/skills/idea-to-pr/artifacts/review/test-coverage-findings.md
cat .claude/skills/idea-to-pr/artifacts/review/comment-quality-findings.md
cat .claude/skills/idea-to-pr/artifacts/review/docs-impact-findings.md
```

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] PR number identified
- [ ] All 5 agent artifacts read
- [ ] Findings extracted from each

---

## Phase 2: SYNTHESIZE - Combine Findings

### 2.1 Aggregate by Severity

Combine all findings across agents:
- **CRITICAL**: Must fix before merge
- **HIGH**: Should fix before merge
- **MEDIUM**: Consider fixing (options provided)
- **LOW**: Nice to have (defer or create issue)

### 2.2 Deduplicate

Check for overlapping findings:
- Same issue reported by multiple agents
- Related issues that should be grouped
- Conflicting recommendations (resolve)

### 2.3 Prioritize

Rank findings by:
1. Severity (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
2. User impact
3. Ease of fix
4. Risk if not fixed

### 2.4 Compile Statistics

```
Total findings: {n}
- CRITICAL: {n}
- HIGH: {n}
- MEDIUM: {n}
- LOW: {n}

By agent:
- code-review: {n} findings
- error-handling: {n} findings
- test-coverage: {n} findings
- comment-quality: {n} findings
- docs-impact: {n} findings
```

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Findings aggregated by severity
- [ ] Duplicates removed
- [ ] Priority order established
- [ ] Statistics compiled

---

## Phase 3: GENERATE - Create Consolidated Artifact

Write to `.claude/skills/idea-to-pr/artifacts/review/consolidated-review.md`:

```markdown
# Consolidated Review: PR #{number}

**Date**: {ISO timestamp}
**Agents**: code-review, error-handling, test-coverage, comment-quality, docs-impact
**Total Findings**: {count}

---

## Executive Summary

{3-5 sentence overview of PR quality and main concerns}

**Overall Verdict**: {APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | NEEDS_DISCUSSION}

**Auto-fix Candidates**: {n} CRITICAL + HIGH issues can be auto-fixed
**Manual Review Needed**: {n} MEDIUM + LOW issues require decision
